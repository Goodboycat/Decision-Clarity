# Why GitHub Pages Won't Work (And What To Do Instead)

## ❌ The Problem with GitHub Pages

**GitHub Pages CANNOT host the Decision Clarity application** because:

### 1. **It Only Serves Static Files**
- GitHub Pages = Static file hosting only
- No Node.js server execution
- No backend code processing

### 2. **This App Requires a Server**
The Decision Clarity app needs:
- **API Routes** (`/api/checkout`, `/api/portal`, `/api/webhook`)
- **Stripe Payment Processing** (server-side)
- **Webhook Handling** (Stripe events)
- **Environment Variables** (secure secrets)
- **Dynamic Server Rendering** (Next.js features)

### 3. **What Breaks on GitHub Pages**
```
❌ Payment System - Needs /api/checkout endpoint
❌ Stripe Webhooks - Needs /api/webhook endpoint  
❌ Customer Portal - Needs /api/portal endpoint
❌ Environment Variables - Can't store secrets
❌ Server Components - No Node.js execution
```

## 💡 Understanding the Architecture

### Static Site (GitHub Pages):
```
Browser → Static HTML/CSS/JS → No backend
```
**Works for:** Blogs, documentation, portfolios

### Full-Stack App (This Project):
```
Browser → Next.js Server → API Routes → Stripe
                ↓
          Database/Storage
```
**Needs:** Server, API endpoints, webhooks

## 🚨 Common Misconceptions

### "Can't I just use GitHub Pages?"
**No.** It's like trying to run a car on bicycle paths. GitHub Pages is for static sites, not full-stack applications.

### "Isn't Vercel expensive?"
**No.** Free tier is very generous:
- 100GB bandwidth/month
- Unlimited sites
- Automatic HTTPS
- Global CDN

### "Is it complicated to deploy?"
**No.** Literally 3 commands:
```bash
npm i -g vercel
vercel
vercel --prod
```

## ✅ Bottom Line

**GitHub Pages:** Great for static sites 📄  
**This App:** Needs a server 🖥️  
**Solution:** Use Vercel (free & easy) 🚀  

**Don't fight the tools.** Use the right platform for the right job.
