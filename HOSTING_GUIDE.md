## üåê Why Not GitHub Pages?

GitHub Pages is designed for **static websites** only:
- ‚ùå No server-side code execution
- ‚ùå No API routes
- ‚ùå No environment variables
- ‚ùå No dynamic rendering
- ‚ùå No webhooks handling

**This app needs:**
- ‚úÖ Server-side API routes (Stripe integration)
- ‚úÖ Dynamic data processing
- ‚úÖ Environment variables
- ‚úÖ Webhook endpoints
- ‚úÖ Server-side rendering

---

## üí° Alternative: Static Version for GitHub Pages

If you want a **demo version** without payment features on GitHub Pages:

### 1. Create Static Branch
```bash
git checkout -b static-demo
```

### 2. Remove API Routes
```bash
rm -rf app/api
```

### 3. Disable Payment Features
Comment out payment-related code in:
- `components/payment/PricingCard.tsx`
- `components/Header.tsx`
- `app/page.tsx`

### 4. Build Static Export
```bash
npm run build
```

### 5. Deploy to GitHub Pages
```bash
# The 'out' directory contains static files
# Enable GitHub Pages in repo settings ‚Üí Pages
# Select branch: gh-pages or main
# Directory: /out or /docs
```

**Note:** This will be a **limited demo** without:
- Payment processing
- Webhook handling
- Server-side features
